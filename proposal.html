    <p>
      I was thinking my website could be about travel information around the
      world. There are so many websites on the web about travelling and I want
      to make a concise website that includes anything you need to know when you
      are booking your next travel destination.I want to include prime spots for
      each season, travel tips, packing lists, restaurants, and tourist
      attractions (with costs).These topics would be a different page on my
      website. My target audience is anyone who likes to travel and needs
      guidance on where to look and the steps to get there as well as some
      inspiration once they get there. I'm going to credit a database based on
      all the information I research on the Internet.
